****************Linux File System Hierarchy**************

/ ------------Starting point of the system — everything starts here

/home -----------Stores home directories for regular users

/root ----------- Stores files and configuration for the root user

/etc ----------- Stores configuration files for the system and applications

/var/log ----------- Stores system and application logs, important for DevOps engineers during monitoring and issue investigation

/tmp ----------- Stores temporary files created by the system and applications

*************Additional Directories*****************************

/bin ----------- Stores essential executable commands required for system operation,Essential commands needed for boot/basic operation

/usr/bin ----------- Contains user executable commands and applications

/opt ----------- Used for installing add-on or third-party applications in separate directories

du -sh /var/log/*
→ Shows disk usage of each file/folder inside /var/log in human-readable format

2>/dev/null
→ Suppresses error messages (like permission denied)

sort -h
→ Sorts results by size (human-readable sorting: K, M, G)

tail -5
→ Shows the 5 largest items

Example Scenario: Check if a service is running

Question: How do you check if the 'nginx' service is running?


systemctl status nginx

The command `systemctl status nginx` is used to check the current status of the Nginx service.

While running this command, I encountered an issue:  
`ConditionFileIsExecutable=/usr/sbin/nginx was not met`.

This indicated that the Nginx executable was missing or not available at the expected path, so the service could not start.

I investigated the issue and found that the binary was not correctly present. I tried enabling and starting the service, but it was unsuccessful. Finally, I resolved the issue by reinstalling the Nginx package.

systemctl list-units --type=service

This command lists all systemd service units that are currently loaded in the system, including their active/inactive state.

systemctl is-enabled nginx

This command checks if the Nginx service is enabled to start automatically at system boot.

Scenario 1: Service Not Starting

A web application service called 'myapp' failed to start after a server reboot.
What commands would you run to diagnose the issue?
Write at least 4 commands in order.

I checked the service status using the following commands:

- sudo systemctl status nginx → to view the current status of the service  
- systemctl is-enabled nginx → to check whether the service is enabled at boot  
- journalctl -u nginx -n 50 → to view the last 50 log entries for the service

Your manager reports that the application server is slow.
You SSH into the server. What commands would you run to identify
which process is using high CPU?

The command `ps aux --sort=-%cpu | head -10` is used to display the top 10 processes consuming the highest CPU resources.

A developer asks: "Where are the logs for the 'docker' service?"

What commands would you use?

systemctl status ssh
Shows current state of the SSH service (running, inactive, failed), along with recent logs.

journalctl -u ssh -n 50
Displays the last 50 logs related to the SSH service for troubleshooting.

journalctl -u ssh -f
Continuously streams live logs of the SSH service (useful for debugging live issues).
